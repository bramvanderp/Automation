# Automation
Small snippets to automate processes.

Feel free to clone or fork my repository and use these snippets in your own flow.

## Branchges
You can either use the [develop](https://github.com/CZYK/Automation/tree/develop) branch with the latest changes of the [master](https://github.com/CZYK/Automation/tree/master) branch which is more stable but might miss some cool new features.
Of course you can also just clone a fixed [release](https://github.com/CZYK/Automation/releases).
